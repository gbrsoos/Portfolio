## Python

| [Wordle Solver](https://github.com/gbrsoos/Wordle-Solver)                                           | Programming, Statistics, Entropy | numpy, pandas            | The project's goal was to create an algorithm that provides support to solve the daily [Wordle Challenge](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). To do so, I implemented an entropy-based solution that gives the most optimal guess based on the game's feedback on the most recently guessed word. |

| [8-Week SQL Challenge](https://github.com/gbrsoos/8WeekSQLChallenge)                                           | Data analysis, data cleaning, data transformation           | This repository contains my weekly solutions on Danny Ma's [#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/). This is a thorough weekly challenge that covers all the basic areas SQL has to offer. The repository is by far not complete yet, this is what I am currently working on. |

| [Wordle Solver](https://github.com/gbrsoos/Wordle-Solver)                                           | Programming, Statistics, Entropy | numpy, pandas            | The project's goal was to create an algorithm that provides support to solve the daily [Wordle Challenge](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). To do so, I implemented an entropy-based solution that gives the most optimal guess based on the game's feedback on the most recently guessed word. |
